# **Girl Script Summer of Code üë®‚Äçüíª**


## **About GSSOC** 


**GirlScript Summer of Code is the 3 month long Open Source program during summers conducted by GirlScript Foundation, started in 2018, with an aim to help beginners get started with Open Source Development. This repository contains the work done by the team as a contribution to GSSOC extended 2020 in th eduration of Aug-Nov.**

## *Backdrop Topic Modeling*

**Topic modeling refers to the task of discovering the underlying thematic structure in a text corpus, where the output is commonly presented as a report of the top terms appearing in each topic. The repo not only provides the code for different algorithms but also takes a dive deep into why we used those methods and hence makes the project a Research Project.**


### Problem 
The task here is we are give the dataset containing articles from Medium and we are required to split them in such a way that we have optimal number of topics.Sounds Easy!? Lets increase the complexity here, while splitting data, if we end up having too few topics it would mean an "overly broad" classification on the other hand choosing too many topics would mean "over-clustering"

term-centric stability analysis strategy

the way to do this is to apply Statistical Modeling and discover abstract topics in our data.   

Let‚Äôs get started!

## *Contents*
1. Dataset used
2. Methodologies Applied 
3. Visualization of model
4. Parameter Tuning 
5. Model Analysis 


## Dataset

Link to the kaggle dataset: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aiswaryaramachandran/medium-articles-with-content)

## Kaggle Notebook
Link to the kaggle notebook: [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/partha2000/topic-modeling-on-medium-articles/notebook)

### How to reproduce: 
The code sample present in this repository will not work on your machine with simple clonning. You will need to install all the dependencies used in the notebook. Further you need download the dataset from the above link and change the working directory inside the notebook to the one of your choice.
